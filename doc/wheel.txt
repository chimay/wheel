WHAT IS IT					*wheel-introduction-what*

Wheel is a navigation plugin for Vim or Neovim. It makes abundant use
of special buffers, in which you can filter and select elements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUFFER GROUPS				*wheel-introduction-buffer-groups*

Wheel let you organize your buffers by creating as many buffer groups as
you need, add the buffers you want to it and quickly navigate between :

- Buffers of the same group
- Buffer groups

Note that :

- A location contains a name, a filename, as well as a line & column number
- A buffer group, in fact a location group, is called a circle
- A set of buffer groups is called a torus (a circle of circles)
- The list of toruses is called the wheel

Why do you need three levels of grouping ?~

At first glance, managing groups with circles in a torus seems to
be sufficient. But with time, the torus grows big, and a third level
helps you to organize your files by groups and categories:

  - The wheel contains all the toruses
  - Each torus contains a category of files, e.g.:
    + configuration, development, publication
  - Each circle contains a project, e.g.:
    + emacs or vifm circles in configuration torus
    + shell or elisp in development torus
    + tea or art in publication torus

A wheel that follows you~
    ~
Wheel is designed to follow your workflow : you only add the files
you want, where you want. For instance, if you have a `organize` group
with agenda & todo files, you can quickly alternate them, or display
them in two windows. Then, if you suddenly got an idea to tune vim,
you switch to the `vim` group with your favorites configuration files in
it. Same process, to cycle, alternate or display the files. Over time,
your groups will grow and adapt to your style.

HISTORY						*wheel-introduction-history*

This project is inspired by :

- CtrlSpace : https://github.com/vim-ctrlspace/vim-ctrlspace, a similar
plugin for Vim

- Unite : https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim and its successor Denite
(Shougo/denite.nvim), a search plugin for arbitray sources

- Torus : https://github.com/chimay/torus, a similar plugin for Emacs,
itself inspired by MTorus

STEP BY STEP						*wheel-step-by-step*

Prefix				|wheel-sbs-prefix|
One map to ring them all	|wheel-sbs-one-map-to-ring-them-all|
First circles			|wheel-sbs-first-circles|
Moving around			|wheel-sbs-moving-around|
Square the circle		|wheel-sbs-square-the-circle|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX						*wheel-sbs-prefix*

In the following discussion, I assume that you have kept the default
mapping prefix : >

 let g:wheel_config.prefix = '<M-w>'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ONE MAP TO RING THEM ALL		*wheel-sbs-one-map-to-ring-them-all*

To get an overview of the Wheel, I suggest you take a look at the main
menu. Press `<M-w>m` and a new buffer will appear, listing the actions
you can perform. Insert mode is used to filter the lines. Press enter
in normal mode to trigger an action (if you know what you’re doing),
or `q` to quit the menu.

If you prefer the meta menu leading you to thematic sub-menus, you can
launch it with `<M-w>=`.

To learn more about menus, see |wheel-special-buffers-menus|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST CIRCLES				    	    *wheel-sbs-first-circles*

Let’s say we have the files `Juice`, `Tea`, `Coffee` and we want to
group them. So, we go to `Juice` and type `<M-w>a` to add a location to
the wheel. If no category (no torus) is present in the wheel, it will
create it and ask for a name. Let’s say we name it `Food`. If no group
(no circle) is found in the torus, it will be created and prompt for a
name. Let’s say we choose `Drinks`. Finally, our file `Juice` is added
to the group. Its name is the filename without extension by default.

Then, we go to `Tea` and type `<M-w>a` again. This time, it will just
ask us if we want to keep the default location name. Press enter, and
`Tea` is added to the `Drinks` group.

Same process with `Coffee`. We now have a circle `Drink` containing
three files.

Now, suppose that in the `Juice` file, you have a Pineapple
and a Mango sections, and you want to compare them. Just go to
the Pineapple section, and use `<M-w>a`. It will add the location
`Juice:pineapple-line:pineapple-col` to the current circle. Then, go to
the Mango section, and do the same. The `Juice:mango-line:mango-col`
will also be added to the circle. You can then easily alternate both,
or display them in split windows.

If you want to create another group (circle), let’s say `Fruits`,
simply launch `<M-w><C-a>`, and answer `Fruits` to the prompt. You can
then add the files `Apple`, `Pear` and `Orange` to it. You can even also
add `Juice`: a file can be added to more than one circle.

If you want to create another category (torus), let’s say `Books`,
simply launch `<M-w><S-a>`, and answer `Books` to the prompt.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOVING AROUND					     *wheel-sbs-moving-around*

Cycling~

You can cycle the files of a circle with `<M-w><Left>` and
`<M-w><Right>`. These are often used bindings, so I suggest you map them
to more convenient keys, like `<C-PageUp>` and `<C-PageDown>`. See
|wheel-mappings-level-10|.

To cycle the circles, use `<M-w><C-Left>` and `<M-w><C-Right>`. You can
also map them to more convenient keys, like `<C-Home>` and `<C-End>`.

To cycle the toruses, use `<M-w><S-Left>` and `<M-w><S-Right>` or
map them to `<S-Home>` and `<S-End>`.

Switch using completion~

You can switch :

- location with completion with `<M-w><Enter>`
- circle with completion with `<M-w><C-Enter>`
- torus with completion with `<M-w><S-Enter>`

Switch using a special buffer~

You can also switch location, circle or torus by chosing it in |wheel-special-buffers|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQUARE THE CIRCLE				*wheel-sbs-square-the-circle*

Over time, the number of circles will grow. Completion is great, but
if you just want to alternate the two last circles in history, you’ll
probably prefer `<M-w>^`.

The main menu offers you these alternate variants :

- Alternate anywhere
- Alternate in the same circle
- Alternate in the same torus
- Alternate in another circle
- Alternate in another torus
- Alternate in same torus but another circle

A common case is to alternate two files in the same circle, and two
circles in the same torus. So, you have the square :

 Alternate    | File 1	        | File 2
--------------|-----------------|-----------------
Circle Drinks | Juice           | Tea
Circle Fruits | Apple           | Pear

at your fingertips.

Menu buffers			|wheel-special-buffers-menus|
Context menus			|wheel-special-buffers-context|
Navigation buffers		|wheel-special-buffers-navigation|
Reordering buffers		|wheel-special-buffers-reordering|

Yank buffer			|wheel-special-buffers-yank|
Batch buffer			|wheel-special-buffers-batch|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION				*wheel-special-buffers-introduction*

Special buffers allow you to perform Wheel operations intuitively, using
full power of your editor : search, yank, paste, completion, and so on.

The available actions depend on the buffer type :

- Menu buffers allow you to launch a wheel function
- Navigation buffers allow you to switch to a :
  + location, circle or torus
  + MRU file, locate file
  + grep result
  + and so on
- Reordering buffers allow you to reorder locations, circles or toruses
- Reorganize buffer allows you fine grain operations
  + Move and copy around locations, circles and toruses
  + Change locations settings like name, line, col
  + Be sure you know what you’re doing

Wrapping up things~

In normal mode, the keys `j`/`k` and `<up>`/`<down>` wrap the buffer :

- If on the first line, `k` or `<up>` will go to the last line
- If on the last line, `j` or `<down>` will go to the first line

Filtering~

In most special buffers, the first line is left empty : it is used as
an input line to filter the buffer. You can go to insert mode and filter
the elements with each word you enter on the input (first) line. Typing
`<Space>`, `<Esc>` or `<Enter>` will update the candidates. Note that `<C-c>`
is not mapped, in case you need to go to normal mode without triggering
the filter function.

A bang "!" beginning a filtering word is a logical not : all lines matching
this word will be removed from the buffer.

A pipe "|" in the middle of a word is a logical or. So, `one|two` will
display lines containing `one` or `two`.

Input history~

An input history is available in insert mode. You can insert the
previous/next input with `<Up>`/`<Down>` or `<M-p>`/`<M-n>`.

The keys `<PageUp>`/`PageDown` or `<M-r>`/`<M-s>` will insert the
previous/next input matching the beginning of the inserted line, until
the cursor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUFFERS STACK				*wheel-special-buffers-stack*

Wheel manages a special buffer stack. You can :

- Save your current special buffer with `<M-w><Tab>`
- Cycle the special buffers with `<M-w>@`
- Remove the current special buffer with `<M-w><Backspace>`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MENU BUFFERS				*wheel-special-buffers-menus*

Each menu has its own dedicated buffer. You can filter the menu lines
by entering words in insert mode.

Main menu~

The main menu is triggered with `<M-w>m` by default. From there, you
can launch the action you want by pressing `<enter>` on its line. Same
thing for `g<enter>`, but it will leave the special buffer opened.

The available actions are grouped by themes and folded. Just open a fold to
access its content.

Meta menu~

Press `<M-w>=` to open the meta menu : each line in this buffer will
launch a sub-menu. Each sub-menu holds the actions of the same category :

- Add a new element to the wheel
- Rename an element
- Delete an element
- Alternate last two elements
- Display elements in tabs
- Display elements in windows
- Display elements in tabs & windows
- Reorganize elements
- Navigation
- Search in files
- Paste from yank wheel

In these sub-menus, you can use the keys :

- `<enter>` : launch the action on the cursor line
- `g<enter>` : launch action and leave the special buffer opened
- `<backspace>` : leads you back to the meta menu.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTEXT MENUS				*wheel-special-buffers-context*

Some special buffers have context menu support. In that case, pressing
`<tab>` will open a menu where you can choose the action you want to
apply to the selected or cursor line(s).

If you change your mind and wish to come back, just press `<backspace>`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAVIGATION BUFFERS			*wheel-special-buffers-navigation*

The navigation buffers allow you to quickly switch to a Wheel location
by pressing `<enter>` on the matching line. The buffer will be opened
in previous used window. You can also use the keys :

- `t` : open buffer in a new tab
- `s` : open buffer in a new split
- `v` : open buffer in a new vsplit
- `S` : open buffer in a new split with golden ratio
- `V` : open buffer in a new vsplit with golden ratio

Same keys as above, but leave the navigation buffer opened :

- `g<enter>` : same as `<enter>`
- `gt` : same as `t`
- `gs` : same as `s`
- `gv` : same as `v`
- `gS` : same as `S`
- `gV` : same as `V`

The navigation buffers also have context menus support.
See |wheel-special-buffers-context|.

Mappings~

The default mappings launching navigation buffers are :

- `<M-w><Space>`   : switch to location
- `<M-w><C-space>` : switch to current location of the chosen circle
- `<M-w><S-space>` : switch to current location of the chosen torus
- `<M-w>x`         : index of toruses > circles > locations
- `<M-w><C-x>`     : index of toruses > circles
- `<M-w><M-x>`     : index with folds (see below)
- `<M-w>:`         : occur in current file
- `<M-w>*`         : grep in circle files
- `<M-w>#`         : outline headers in circle files
- `<M-w>t`         : tags
- `<M-w>?`         : most recently used files not found in wheel (mru)
- `<M-w>/`         : search files with `locate`
- `<M-w>&`         : search files with `find` in async mode

Menus~

The navigation buffers can also be launched from the main & meta menus.

Folding~

The map `<M-w><M-x>` opens a dedicated buffer where folds are used to
reflect the tree structure of the Wheel : toruses, circles and locations.

Filtering in that buffer will keep surrounding folds ; only non mathing
empty folds will be removed.

Selection~

Pressing `<Space>` will toggle the selection of the current line. If a
line is selected, it will begin with an asterisk. You can then open all
selected files in tabs, splits or vertical splits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REORDERING BUFFERS			*wheel-special-buffers-reordering*

The reordering buffers allow you to quickly reorder Wheel elements by
reordering the buffer lines. You can use yank/delete/paste operations to
perform the reordering, or sort them with |:sort|.

Please yank/delete entire lines, or your data could loose their integrity.

To validate your change, simply |:write| the buffer.

The number of lines will be checked and, if there is missing or excedent
lines, Wheel will refuse to apply your change.

Mappings~

The default mappings launching reordering buffers are :

- `<M-w>o`     : reorder locations
- `<M-w><C-o>` : reorder circles
- `<M-w>O`     : reorder toruses

Menus~

The reordering buffers can also be launched from the main & meta menus.

Pressed the wrong button ?~

If something goes wrong, you can quit the buffer and re-read the wheel
variables with `<M-w>r`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REORGANIZING BUFFERS			*wheel-special-buffers-reorganizing*

The reorganizing buffer allows you to quickly reorganize the Wheel
elements. All elements of the wheel are represented, and folds are used
to reflect the tree structure of the Wheel :

- torus names
- circle names
- locations (the dictionary lines)

You can :

- copy or move elements by copying or moving the buffer lines
  + copy or move a location to another circle
  + copy or move a circle to another torus
  + reordering elements (but without check)
- rename elements
- change line or column of a location

Please move or copy entire lines, or your data could loose their
integrity. Be aware that removing a line will remove the corresponding
element from the wheel.

To validate your change, simply |:write| the buffer.

Mappings~

The default mapping is `<M-w><M-o>`.

Menus~

The reorganizing buffer can also be launched from the main & meta menus.

Pressed the wrong button ?~

If something goes wrong, you can quit the buffer and re-read the wheel
variables with `<M-w>r`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YANK BUFFER				*wheel-special-buffers-yank*

As usual, you can filter the elements in insert mode.
The available local maps are :

 - `<enter>` : paste a yank after cursor
 - `g<cr>` : paste a yank after cursor, leave yank wheel opened
 - `p` : paste a yank after cursor, leave yank wheel opened
 - `P` : paste a yank before cursor, leave yank wheel opened

List mode~

The yank wheel buffer in list mode is launched by `<M-w>y`.

Each line of the special buffer is one of your yanks, represented as a
list, one element per line.

Plain mode~

The yank wheel buffer in plain mode is launched by `<M-w><M-y>`.

All your yanks are concatenated and displayed in the special buffer.
You can also go to visual mode and paste your selection.

Menus~

The yank wheel buffers can also be launched from the main & meta menus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BATCH BUFFER				*wheel-special-buffers-batch*

See |wheel-batch-command|.

==============================================================================
BATCH OPERATIONS				    *wheel-batch-operations*

Batch command			|wheel-batch-command|
Grep search			|wheel-batch-grep|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BATCH COMMAND					    *wheel-batch-command*

The command : >

 :WheelBatch {my_command}
<

uses the argument list to execute `my_command` on each location of the
current circle. The command can be a vim `:command` or an external shell
`!command`. The ouput is displayed in a dedicated buffer.

Mapping~

Default mapping : `<M-w><M-b>`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GREP SEARCH					    *wheel-batch-grep*

The command : >

 :WheelGrep {my_pattern}
<

launches a |:grep| search in the current circle files. The results are
displayed in the usual |quickfix| window.

Mapping~

Default mapping : `<M-w>*`

    let g:wheel_config.maxim = {}
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE						    *wheel-config-file*

File to save or load the wheel : >

    let g:wheel_config.file = '~/.local/share/wheel/auto.vim'
<

Note that the directory `~/.local/share/wheel` must exist.

It is highly recommended to define this file and regularly save it,
either manually or automatically, using the autowrite config.

AFTER JUMP				*wheel-autocommands-after-jump*

The user autocommands `WheelAfterJump` are executed at the end of each
navigation operation in the Wheel ; basically, each time you jump to
another file using wheel group functions.

This example fold everything except the cursor line : >

    autocmd User WheelAfterJump norm zMzx
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTO FOLLOW		    		*wheel-autocommands-auto-follow*

If you wish the wheel to auto-follow the buffers you enter, you can add
this autocommand : >

    autocmd BufEnter * call wheel#projection#follow()
<

It will work for all buffer filenames belonging to the wheel. It is
useful when you search with grep and the quickfix window, or when you
edit a file with a classic vim command.

Be aware that it will update the wheel cursor position of your buffer,
which makes sense.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTO UPDATE				*wheel-autocommands-auto-update*

If you want to update your cursor position each time you leave a buffer : >

  autocmd BufLeave * call wheel#vortex#update()
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MRU files				    *wheel-autocommands-mru-files*

If you want to record a list of the files you edited without adding them
to the wheel : >

  autocmd BufRead * call wheel#attic#record()
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YANK WHEEL					*wheel-autocommands-yank*

If you want to record your yanks/delete, you can add this autommand to
your init file : >

 autocmd TextYankPost * call wheel#codex#add()
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE					    *wheel-autocommands-example*

Here is an example of a complete autocommands configuration : >

  " On vim enter, for autoreading
  autocmd VimEnter * call wheel#void#init()
  " On vim leave, for autowriting
  autocmd VimLeave * call wheel#void#exit()
  " Executed after jumping to a location
  autocmd User WheelAfterJump norm zMzx
  " For current wheel location to auto follow buffer change
  autocmd BufEnter * call wheel#projection#follow()
  " Update location line & col before leaving a window
  autocmd BufLeave * call wheel#vortex#update()
  " Add current file to MRU files
  autocmd BufRead * call wheel#attic#record()
  " To record your yanks in the yank wheel
  autocmd TextYankPost * call wheel#codex#add()
<

User interface			|wheel-functions-user-interface|
Async command			|wheel-functions-async-command|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER INTERFACE				*wheel-functions-user-interface*

The functions used as User Interface are listed :

- In the mappings of autoload/wheel/centre.vim
- In the menus of autoload/wheel/crystal.vim

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASYNC COMMAND					*wheel-functions-async-command*

wheel#wave#start({command})			*wheel-wave-start*
	Neovim only, for now.
	Start an async command and display its output in a special buffer.
	You can filter buffer content, as usual.
	Still experimental.

MAPPINGS						    *wheel-mappings*

Levels				|wheel-mappings-levels|
Prefix				|wheel-mappings-prefix|
Mnemonic			|wheel-mappings-mnemonic|
Level 0				|wheel-mappings-level-0|
Level 1				|wheel-mappings-level-1|
Level 2				|wheel-mappings-level-2|
Level 10			|wheel-mappings-level-10|
List of plug maps		|wheel-mappings-plugs|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVELS						    *wheel-mappings-levels*

The mappings are organized in levels :

- Level 0  : basic
- Level 1  : common
- Level 2  : advanced
- Level 10 : non-prefix mappings

If you set the option `g:wheel_config.prefix` to an integer `N`, all
mappings of level less or equal to `N` will be bound to keys. So, the
higher this option, the more mappings available.

E.g., if you set it to 2 : >

    let g:wheel_config.prefix = 2
<
mappings levels 0, 1 and 2 will be available.

Level 1 or 2 is fine for most usages. Level 10 is interesting if you are
looking for ideas of non-prefix mappings. See |wheel-mappings-level-0| and
subsequent for more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFIX						    *wheel-mappings-prefix*

Default mappings of levels 0, 1, 2 use a prefix key. This prefix is `<M-w>` by
default. You can customize it : >

    let g:wheel_config.prefix = '<my-wonderful-prefix>'
<

I like to set it to `<D-w>`, but since the `<D-...>` mappings don't seem
to work in terminal or with Gvim, it is not the default. It's working on
Neovim-qt, though : >

    let g:wheel_config.prefix = '<D-w>'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MNEMONIC					*wheel-mappings-mnemonic*

Most mappings respect the following convention :

- prefix + `letter`     : location operation
- prefix + `<C-letter>` : circle operation
- prefix + `<S-letter>` : location operation
- prefix + `<M-letter>` : alternative operation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVEL 0						*wheel-mappings-level-0*

Menus~

The most important mapping is `<M-w>m` : it launches a menu in a
special buffer, and from there you can trigger all sort of actions on
the Wheel. See |wheel-special-buffers-menu| for more information.

| Prefix + | With default prefix | Action                  |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| m        | <M-w>m              | Main menu               |
